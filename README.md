# BigTwoBot

All script written in response to NCSS challenge 2019, where my bot competes in big two matches.

The competition is seperated into three stages.
- single: only single card is played each turn
- triple: single, double and triple combinations are allowed
- full: all big two combinations are allowed

My solution to each stages is placed in the directory corresponding to that stage.
I had different solutions for each stages, written in seperated scripts.
